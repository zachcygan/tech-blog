## Dependencies Used
    - sequelize
    - dotenv
    - express
    - mysql2

## Instructions

To begin, type "npm i" in your console to ensure any dependencies are installed. Ensure that a .env file is created with the user root and your password. Then select the database with mysql and seed the test data by typing "node seeds/index.js" in your console from the server.js file. You may then start the server by typing "npm start" in the console. Use Insomnia or any similar program to perform different requests to the routes on the database.
